# Grab Bag Prototype
This repository features a .NET Console application that functions as a text-based prototype game. The main focus of this project was to rapidly test out different systems and create a mockup architecture for how different game componenets could be designed, how the game might function mechanically, and a simple gameplay loop.

This project was written in C#, as the game engine I will most likely use for developing further prototypes is Unity, which features .NET and C# as its scripting language.
